# Fragments ðŸ“±
 Master-Detail Navigation/Communication with Fragments.
 
 Sir, I just made fragments. I didn't know how to show data of CountryDetailFragment and CountryListFragment in MainActivity with respect to orientation. I searched over the internet but didn't get perfect content due to shortage of time. I apologize for unable to complete the assignment but i can do complete the assignment just after submisstion of this assignment.
